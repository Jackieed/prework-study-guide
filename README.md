# Prework-Study-Guide-Webpage

## Description

This is a prework study guide created by students in the UCI Bootcamp for coding. I built this project in order to learn and utilize the concepts we learned in class, for example, HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. This project solved a multitude of problems including randomizing the topics we learned, debugging certain codes that wouldn't let us load the script for JavaScript, and creating a user friendly webpage.

## Usage

Each section of the Prework Study Guide is blocked in chunks to allow the user to see what each topic covers. For example, if the user want to create a strong foundation for a webpage, then they should start with the HTML. If the user wants to add more style to their webpage, then they should go with CSS. Finally, if the user wants to create an interactive webpage, then JavaScript. The sections has a header on top of it to present to the user the different topics. If you were to open the DevTools console, the JavaScript would be running and will give you a topic to start studying first.
